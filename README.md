Description:
A VBA homework assignment for University of Denver Data Analytics Boot Camp.
Using VBA in Excel, I created a script that sorts through three years of stock price data for numerous companies. It calculates a ticker symbol for each company and their corresponding total stock volume, yearly dollar change, and yearly percentage change for three years. 

File Description:
- Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx is the starter stock market data that the script was run on.
- Moderate Stock HW is the notepad file that can be copy and pasted to run in the above starter data (Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) file to solve for homework questions below.

Stock Market Analysis for Moderate Level Homework, which was completed:
- Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year
- You will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume
- Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info
- Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was
- The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
- The total Volume of the stock
- Ticker symbol
- You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red
